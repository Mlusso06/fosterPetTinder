    <p>Caring for a companion animal goes far beyond providing food, water and shelter. It takes research and
        careful planning to bring the right pet into your home, and to make sure your lifestyle is the right one for
        your pet. Read on for tips to prepare yourself, as well as your home, for a new furry friend.</p>
    <h3>Are You Ready to Adopt?</h3>
    <p>When adopting, you are making a commitment to care for an animal for the rest of his life—that could mean 10
        to 15 years for dogs and up to 20 years for cats. As you go through lifestyle changes such as moves, the
        birth of children and new jobs, your animal will remain a permanent part of your life. If circumstances
        change, will you still be able to care for your pet?</p>
    <div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Expand to read more</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Owning a dog or cat costs more than the initial adoption fee. Food, veterinary care, spaying or
                neutering and proper identification—that means a collar with tags and a more permanent form of ID
                such as microchipping—can add up.</li>
            <li>Time is also a factor. Dogs benefit from several hours of exercise and companionship every day. Cats
                are healthiest and happiest indoors and love to be treated to energetic play sessions. If your work
                demands that you travel often, or if you're out of the house most days and evenings, this may not be
                the right time to adopt.</li>
            <li>It is important to consider whether your children, along with your resident pets, are able to
                accommodate the addition of a cat or dog to your household.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Which Pet Is Right for You?</h3>
    <p>Your personality and lifestyle, along with challenges such as space restrictions and amount of time spent at
        home, should be explored to determine what pet is right for your household. Research different breeds and
        ask shelter staffers for guidance—they're experts at making perfect matches!</p>
    <h3>If You’re Considering Adopting a Dog:</h3>
    <p>Loyal and loving, dogs are social animals who thrive on being upstanding members of their families.</p>
    <div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Expand to read more</span>
        <ul>
            <li>If there are young children in your home, a puppy may not be your best bet. You may want to consider
                adopting a medium-sized dog over five months of age.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea to draw up a schedule of who in the family will help with the care of your new
                dog, including walking, playing, feeding and grooming.</li>
            <li>Don’t forget to have your new friend spayed or neutered.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Pit Bull Adoption Tips</h3>
    <p>Thinking about adopting a pit bull? Congratulations! Pit bulls can make very sweet and loyal family dogs.
        Adopting a pit bull should be fun and joyful, so we’ve created a list of handy tips to help you make good
        choices. </p>
    <div class="ready-accordion"><span class="ready-accordion-header">Expand to read more</span>
        <p><strong>Socialization is the key to a happy and confident dog.</strong> All puppies should be enrolled in
            a puppy class where part of the time is devoted to off-leash play with other dogs. </p>
        <p><strong>Pit bulls are enthusiastic learners.</strong> They enjoy trick training and many graduate at the
            head of their obedience classes. There are many pit bull rescue groups that can recommend training
            classes. </p>
        <p><strong>It’s play time!</strong> Pits are moderately active indoors and extremely active outdoors—be
            prepared to spend a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes twice a day engaged in aerobic-level activities with
            your dog.</p>
        <p><strong>You may experience breed discrimination.</strong>
